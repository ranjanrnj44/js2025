// NOTE "this" in NORMAL FUNCTION refers to current object and it is evaluated at the runtime and it is purely based on where it is being executed
// NOTE: "this" inside the ARROW FUNCTION refers to it's lexical surrounding scope and it is not like the regular function

1. Here the function makeUser returns an object.

What is the result of accessing its ref? Why?

function makeUser() {
  return {
    name: "John",
    ref: this
  };
}

let user = makeUser();

alert( user.ref.name ); // What's the result?
*/

// the result is error because the makeUser() with .ref is treated as property and not as a method. If ref is a method then it will have object context and with the "alert( user.ref.name );" this will give "JOHN"
// In strict mode "this" will be resulted as undefined



/*
2. Create an object calculator with three methods:

read() prompts for two values and saves them as object properties with names a and b respectively.
sum() returns the sum of saved values.
mul() multiplies saved values and returns the result.
*/

let calculator = {
    a: 0,
    b: 0,
    read(){
        this.a = prompt("Enter the A value");
        this.b = prompt("Enter the A value");
    },
    sum(){
        return this.a+this.b
    },
    mul(){
        return this.a*this.b
    }
};
calculator.read();
alert(calculator.sum());
alert(calculator.mul());


/*
3. Thereâ€™s a ladder object that allows you to go up and down:

let ladder = {
  step: 0,
  up() {
    this.step++;
  },
  down() {
    this.step--;
  },
  showStep: function() { // shows the current step
    alert( this.step );
  }
};
Now, if we need to make several calls in sequence, we can do it like this:

ladder.up();
ladder.up();
ladder.down();
ladder.showStep(); // 1
ladder.down();
ladder.showStep(); // 0
Modify the code of up, down, and showStep to make the calls chainable, like this:

ladder.up().up().down().showStep().down().showStep(); // shows 1 then 0
Such an approach is widely used across JavaScript libraries.
*/
let ladder = {
  step: 0,
  up() {
    this.step++;
    return this; // NOTE:  Here we have to return "this" which return the object and that is necessary for chaining up further, if you called "this.step" then it will return a primitive value as 1 and right after showStep() we can't chain since showStep had written the primitive value
  },
  down() {
    this.step--;
    return this;
  },
  showStep: function() { // shows the current step
    alert( this.step );
    return this;
  }
};
ladder.up().up().down().showStep().down().showStep();
